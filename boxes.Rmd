# Boxes (ideas)


* Box 1: basic glossary/concepts (instance, "spin up", HPC, ...) (do this later)
* Box 2: (MPS) scalable alternatives to the cloud. Availability is *highly* variable. Costs and benefits (cost, flexibility, admin load â€¦) have to be considered carefully.
* Box 3: Gaps (EW)

* data storage solutions
    * temporary storage solution, not an archive
    * objections to S3: not well-integrated with EC2; specialized data transfer modes
    * need user-level answers/best practices/basic concepts
    * use KNB (NCEAS data repo)
    * Center for Open Science (workflow repository)
    * don't want to mandate openness?
    * security
* all technologies are rapidly evolving
* funding and prep for the cloud is lacking; need HOWTO teach and setup and acquire the cloud
* Box 4: recommendations (EW)
people should start doing this stuff in the classroom!
encourage campus/local IT to support virtual environments (not just classic HPC model)
