## Stage 1: Teaching in the cloud (msmorul)

Teaching "*in* the cloud" means using cloud/remote services for teaching (typically) introductory/undergraduate quantitative material. The goal is for the local vs. remote distinction to be largely transparent to the end-users (students); they only know that they have to go to URL (xxx) in order to use R/Python whatever.  (Instructors of stage 1 courses need to start at stage 2 so they have basic administrative/troubleshooting skills required.)

### Advantages

* make instructors' lives easier
* accessibility
* uniformity of the students’ work environments
* usage via pre-defined systems (e.g., genomics, Rocker, etc.)
* improved pedagogy for students, learn to work in clean environment
* empower/lower barriers for later transition to the cloud/remote computing
* avoid command-line bullshittery, but get buy-in of remote use for later

### Disadvantages
licensing/usage/copyright restrictions by institutions
costs?
end-user systems not configured to work independently
 good set of “teaching images” not yet available


### Learning objectives

* *mostly* not remote-computing-related: remote computing is a means to an end
* (some) awareness of remote computing (data staging, etc)


### Examples

* Duke intro stats
* Berkeley: Jupyter/Python in the cloud
* Google Group of folks using JupyterHub for teaching https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter-education
* SESYNC viz course - local vm’s
